# 3D Printing

These are instructions to quickly 3D print something.

Excluding time to download, install dependencies, and waiting for your first 3D print to finish, _**you will be able to complete this tutorial in ~10 minutes**_

## 0. Preface

***Here's the deal***: You'll either get a cheap 3D printer (<$100) and spend a lot of time troubleshooting or you'll invest in a higher quality one and not have as many headaches. Regardless, after considering consumables below, **3D printing will add up**.

Consumable | Price per Unit | Price per Print
--- | --- | ---
PLA Filament | ~$20/1kg spool | 20 × 50g prints = $1/print
Electricity | $0.30/kWh in California | 1kWh/10hr print = $0.30/print

The 3D printer used in this tutorial is the Entina Tina2 Basic (~$150), a.k.a WEEDO/WEEFUN Tina2, Monoprice MP Cadet, Bresser Raptor, etc. This printer is small, compact, and has auto-leveling capability which should make life a bit easier.

> Footprint of the Tina2 printer is 8¼" Length × 8¼" Width × 11½" Height with a printing area of 120 mm (4.7 inch) Length × 100 mm (3.9 inch) Width × 100 mm (3.9 inch) Height

## 1. Requirements

You will need a computer to download or create 3D models and to "slice" them into instructions specifically for the Tina2's printing specifications.

The Tina2 Basic can only read files via a microSD card (8GB card and USB reader included) or direct connection to your computer via a USB cable (not included).

There will be a small spool of PLA filament included (100g), this will only be enough for a few large prints.

## 2. First Print

Unpack your printer, remove all protective materials, load the spool of filament through the feeder clip (green arrow), pull up on the feeder clip (blue arrow), and pinch the end of the filament right between the metal teeth (red arrow). Turn on the printer from the switch on the AC adapter cable and start the `Load Filament` process.

Since the printer comes with a microSD card preloaded with models, all you have to do for your first print is insert the microSD card in the slot to the left of the LCD screen, find the model you want to print, and *print*!

The first print I did was the square test. After the printer warming up, this printed in about 10 minutes and came out relatively clean, square, and smooth.
